4. Flag squares you think contain mines
5. Clear all safe squares to win!

### Basic Rules

- **üéØ Win Condition:** Reveal all squares that don't contain mines
- **üí£ Lose Condition:** Click on a square containing a mine
- **üî¢ Number Clues:** Each number indicates how many mines are in the 8 surrounding squares
- **üö© Flagging:** Mark suspected mines with flags to avoid accidentally clicking them

### Game Objective
